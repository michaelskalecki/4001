Pointers in C
-------------

1) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *temp;
  strcpy(temp, argv[0]);
  return 0;
}

Why is the above code incorrect (i.e., likely to crash)?
-> temp is an uninitialized pointer containing garbage and could be pointing to anywhere in memory.

2) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char temp[9];
  strcpy(temp, argv[0]);
  return 0;
}

A buffer overflow occurs when the program name is 9 characters long
(e.g., "12345.exe"). Why?
-> strcpy also includes '\0' after copying the name, requiring memory for another char.

3) Consider the following C program.
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *buffer = "Hello";
  strcpy(buffer, "World");
  return 0;
}

Why does this program crash?
-> the strings may not overlap but they do overlap since there is an 'l' in both.

4) Consider the following C snippet.
void myfunc()
{
  char b[100];
  char *buffer = &b[0];
  strcpy(buffer, "World");
}

Is this correct?  What's a simpler expression for &b[0]?
-> this is correct. b is the same as &b[0]


5) Consider the following C program.
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  printf("%s %s %s\n", *argv, (*(argv+1)) + 2, *(argv+2));
  return 0;
}

If this code is executed using the following line, what will be the output?
> program1 -n5 abc
-> output is: program1 5 abc


6) Consider the following C program.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
char *myfunc(char **argv)
{
  char buffer[100];
  strcpy(buffer, "hello");
  return buffer;
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *s = myfunc(argv);
  printf("%s\n", s);
}

What's wrong with this?
->
